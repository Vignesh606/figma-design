 E-Cell VIT Bhopal Landing Page Design

Project Overview

This repository contains the official UI/UX design deliverables for the E-Cell (Entrepreneurship Cell) VIT Bhopal Startup & Innovation Hub landing page. The design aims to create a vibrant, professional, and high-energy digital presence that clearly communicates E-Cell's mission to prospective student founders, mentors, and partners.

The design focuses on key conversion goals: event registration, startup application submissions, and community engagement.

🎨 Design Goals & Philosophy

Vibrancy & Trust: Use a modern, energetic color palette (Teal, Indigo, and Bright Yellow) to reflect innovation and professionalism.

Clarity: Ensure clear hierarchy and strong readability across all sections.

Responsiveness: Deliver an optimal viewing and interaction experience on both desktop and mobile devices.

Action-Oriented: Guide users toward core activities (pitching ideas, joining the team, registering for events) through prominent Call-to-Action (CTA) elements.

✨ Key Features & Sections

The design concept includes the following structure, optimized for user flow:

Navbar: Sticky navigation with essential links (Home, Events, Startups, Team, Contact) and a primary "Apply Now" CTA.

Hero Section: High-impact area featuring a compelling headline ("Ignite Your Idea. Launch Your Legacy."), social proof, and direct links for idea pitching.

Featured Startups: A carousel/grid showcasing E-Cell's successful ventures, enhanced with founder testimonials for social proof.

Upcoming Events: A section highlighting key future events, with a distinct feature card for the next major flagship event.

Why Join E-Cell: A concise, icon-driven feature list detailing the benefits of joining (Mentorship, Funding, Community).

Footer: Comprehensive contact information, social links, and quick navigation.
